This github repository contains the [website](http://takeonme.org) for the Austin Hackers Anonymous group. Someone should really update it to make it suck less.

## Local Dev

If you want to make changes and test them locally, you'll need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

### Run the webserver

```sh
hugo server -t terminal
```

This will launch a local web server running on <http://localhost:1313> that auto-updates the test site live when changes are detected on disk.
