@todb talked about [Goofing Off with
EICAR](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11r40AkYQ17KIcQ-cWzF-2HflW473RavU6Qy7iDQhVlQ/edit?usp=sharing),
and then bought a round for the room so he could spend 3 extra minutes
shilling for a job he's hiring for,
the [Metasploit Payload
Wizard](https://careers-rapid7.icims.com/jobs/1602/metasploit-payload-wizard/job).
It's a fun and demanding job, being a
[wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Daj9LN8xsFk).

It was all very well recieved. Especially the free beer.
