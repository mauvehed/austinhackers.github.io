I presented on a means by which to discover all possible paths from a
source address to a destination in a dissassembly. My script will output
an IDC file that will color the basic block nodes in IDA so that you may
easily distinguish the path. This technique has proven useful for
finding both original bugs and alternate exploitation vectors for
existing vulnerabilities.
