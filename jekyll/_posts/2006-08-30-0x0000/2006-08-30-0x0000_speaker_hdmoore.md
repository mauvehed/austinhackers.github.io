Hacking with the Nokia 770

The Nokia 770 is a hand-held Linux device that is designed for quick and
convenient internet browsing.
The device supports 802.11b, 80211.g, and Bluetooth. My talk described
how the resource limits of
the Nokia 770 preclude it from becoming a true mobile penetration
testing platform. Based on the
rumor that Immmunity's SILICA device is based on the 770, I made some
predictions about performance
problems, stability, and effectiveness of the SILICA platform in the
real world. I concluded the
talk with an outline of my own plans for the Nokia device:

1) Develop an interface that has 4 large buttons and a console log
2) The first mode puts the WiFi card into monitor mode and captures data
3) The second mode enters hostap mode and performs client-side
attacks/password theft
4) The third mode joins each WiFi network and performs reconaissance
5) The fourth mode launches a small set of attacks on all nodes of all
networks

Tracking with TOR

The TOR project was designed to allow anonymous communication over the
internet. Unfortunately,
a number of folks are using public TOR servers to search for and
download child pornography.
My talk described a series of countermeasures for detecting, tracking,
and prosecuting
pedophiles that are using TOR. The source code will be released in the
near future.
