Quick and Dirty MySpace E-Mail Enumeration

An easy filter development at work leads to a fun discovery â€” MySpaceIM
returns "bad username" or "bad password" messages in the event of a
login failure. Thus, it's easy to write a brute force / dictionary-based
e-mail address enumerator to discover valid MySpace accounts.

This silly talk lasted about 10 minutes, and [slides and
source](http://www.planb-security.net/aha/Myspace_Account_Enumeration.ppt) are
available.

Since AHA 0x00, MySpace fixed this. Apparently, they took it more
seriously than I did. But not serious enough to offer thanks for the
vuln report, about which I now whine on [my
blog](http://www.planb-security.net/2006/09/myspaceim-info-disclosure-silently.html).
