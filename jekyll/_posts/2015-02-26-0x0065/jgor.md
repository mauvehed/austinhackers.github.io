[jgor](https://twitter.com/indiecom) discussed his [dork-cli](https://github.com/jgor/dork-cli) command-line tool for finding dynamic pages via Google dorks. He also showed the dorkbot wrapper that automatically combs search results for a set of domains and automatically scans them for vulnerabilities via wapiti, and the Splunk interface to process and display the wapiti JSON reports.
