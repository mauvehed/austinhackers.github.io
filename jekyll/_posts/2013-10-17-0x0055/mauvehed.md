I gave a presentation on the new AHA website hosted through [Github
Pages](https://github.com/AustinHackers/austinhackers.github.io). This
talk outlines the [Pull Request
process](https://github.com/AustinHackers/austinhackers.github.io/blob/master/README.md)
and how you can contribute to the website with speaker notes or your own
major revisions (which are welcomed!).

If you have questions about the process please let me know:
