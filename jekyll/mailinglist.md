# {{ page.title }}

The mailing list is open to anyone who lives in Austin, Texas and has spoken at one of our [meetings]({{ site.meetingpage }}) and follow our [rules]({{ site.aboutuspage }}). **Subscription requests are moderated** and subject to a screening process â€” if we don't know who you are, you will be asked to give a quick introduction and verify that you have spoken at a meeting.

<B><FONT COLOR="red">DO NOT APPLY TO THE LIST IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN AT OUR MEETINGS. YOU WILL BE REJECTED</FONT></B>

To subscribe, join our [chat]({{ site.chatpage }}) channels and ask for an invite. You will need to provide your email address to do so. You can either leave it in the channel or ask for someone who can add you and wait to give it to them.

Note that you should not consider applying to the list without answering yes to the following:

* Are you local to Austin? 
* Have you been to a meeting yet?
* Have you introduced yourself to us in person yet?
* Have you spoken at a meeting yet? **<--REQUIRED, intro talks don't count**
