While traditionally the best way to communicate in AHA was the [mailing
list]({{ site.mailinglistpage }}), now the most common place to find us
is on chat. We can be found via a number of private or invite services.

### Discord (public'ish)
* Invite: [discord.gg/yMvbvst](https://discord.gg/yMvbvst)
* Channel: aha-public
* AHA! Members should ask for role to access aha-private

### IRC (private)
* Server: irc.libera.chat:6697 (SSL)
* Channel: #AHA
* Channel key required

### Slack (private)
* Server: austinhackers.slack.com
* Invite required

There are no specific channel rules, but please do not ask stupid
questions like, "How do I hack X" or showing up to simply cause drama.
This is a good place to talk to speakers from past meetings about their
projects, or to look for feedback on your own talk.

## FAQ

* All of the above chat methods are linked together. However, the public channel
on Discord is isolated from the IRC and Slack. There is a private members channel
that is bridged from Discord. Only members will be granted access.

**How do I gain membership?**

* Speak at a [meeting]({{ site.meetingpage }}) and socialize.

**How do I get an AHA hostcloak on IRC?**

* Beg.

Anything that deserves a longer conversation, planning, or feedback from
more members, should probably be taken to the [mailing list]({{ site.mailinglistpage }}).
